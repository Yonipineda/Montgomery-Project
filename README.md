# Montgomery County, MD Crime Predictor Project

---

## Dash app

In development. Going over unfinished work and will be deployed sometime soon.

---

## Data

The data source can be found at [dataMontgomery](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime/icn6-v9z3)

The cleaned data can be found in the notebooks folder, named [Cleaned_Crime.csv](notebooks/Cleaned_Crime.csv)

## Notebooks

All of the data exploration can be found there.

For the cleaning process, refer to [Montgomery_Cleaning.ipynb](notebooks/Montgomery_Cleaning.ipynb)

For the Model Process, refer to [Montgomery_Model.ipynb](notebooks/Montgomery_Model.ipynb)

The basis for this project has to do with wanting to find out how my intuition matched with the data for the occurance of crime.
It was our Unit2 Final Project at [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/).
